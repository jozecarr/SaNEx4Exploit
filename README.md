# SaNEx4Exploit
## By Joe ;)
enjoy :}

## How to use:
Use `bash exploit.sh`.
This will:
- Add /admin/shellex.php to the website using the /admin/list.php?path=;cmdToInject vulnerability.
- Alias the run bash file as "rn" so commands can also be ran without using the shellex page simply with the terminal.

### How to use shellex.php
- navigate to http://192.168.103.3/admin/shellex.php/ or http://sensiblefurniture.com/admin/shellex.php/
- you can put your commands in the input box and press run to run them.

###How to use shellex.php
- the command rn <command> should run a command as the web server and show you it's outputs just like shellex but instead just in the terminal.
